Civilians bear the brunt of the crisis, with 22.2 million Yemenis now in need of humanitarian assistance. Those forced to flee their homes are especially at risk. 2 million people now languish in desperate conditions, away from home and deprived of basic needs. The situation is so dire that almost 1 million displaced Yemenis have lost hope and tried to return home, even though it is not yet safe. Yemen is facing a humanitarian catastrophe. Without help, many more lives will be lost to violence, treatable illnesses or lack of food, water and shelter.",
